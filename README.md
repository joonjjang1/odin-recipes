I am learning HTML through odin-project, which is good so far
I have learned a structure, elements, and attributes of HTML
Also, more practically than any other resourse for learning HTML, I've learned how to use GitHub and do commit
For elements, I have learned !DOCTYPE, head, title, body, h1 as heads of paragraph,and p as paragraph. There should be open and close elements always like <h1></h1>
There are void elements, which don't use close. In this case, if necessary, just add attribute inside elements.
For attribute, href in <a> for link and src, alt, height, and width in <img> for image are what I've learned
For github, after creating a certain repository, you are able to clone that repo on your local machine by several ways like https, ssh and etc. In this course, using ssh is highly recommended. git clone ssh is the one which can copy the content from github to your local machine
